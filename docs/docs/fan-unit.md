:::note
When using the standard Fan Unit only the Left pins can be used for PWM

## Fan Installation

The Fan Units are designed for 5V 40x20mm Fans for example the included [NF-A4x20 5V PWM](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a4x20-5v-pwm). To attach the fan to the Fan Unit follow the following steps:

1. Connect the plastic [left](https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade/blob/main/fan-unit/fan-bracket/left.stl) and [right](https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade/blob/main/fan-unit/fan-bracket/right.stl) fan brackets to the fan.
The Numbs on the button of the bracket should face the back of the Fan Unit.
2. Attach the Fan to the Fan Unit. Insert the front of the fan unit first then press firmly on the back.
3. connect The Fan Cable to the [4 Pin Fan Header](https://www.molex.com/en-us/products/part-detail/0470531000)

Your fan is not installed in the Fan Unit.

## Ideas for Smart Fan Unit

Adjusts the speed and color of the digital LEDs depending on the temperature of the airflow. You can specify the desired speed from both blades simply by UART.

Blades can report processor temperatures via UART, and the Smart Fan Unit sets the fan speed and color of the digital LEDs.

The programable button can be use for identification of the Smart Fan Unit.
