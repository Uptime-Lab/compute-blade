# Imaging Storage Media

You can boot the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) in several ways on the Compute Blade

:::note
Preboot eXecution Environment(PXE) is a prosses to boot a computer over the a network. It will not be covered here. Aee our [deticated guide](/blade/advanced-guides/pxe-booting/) for more information
:::

## Pepare Storage Media

To prepare a storage media you will need another computer

<Tabs groupId="boot" defaultValue="ssd">
    <TabItem value="microsd" label="microSD Card" >
        <Admonition type="warning">
            Only the Dev model Compute Blade has a microSD Card slot
        </Admonition>
        <Admonition type="note">
            CM4s with part number `CM4XXX000` must be used as others have eMMC and are unable to use MicroSD Card slot
            <img src='/img/cm4-box.png' width="250" alt='CM4 box with model number highlighted'/>
        </Admonition>
        The microSD Card needs to be at least 8GB. Your computer may not have a microSD Card slot and need an adapter.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ssd" label="SSD">
        <Admonition type="warning">
            The Compute Blade supports M key and B+M key M.2 devices, from size `2230` to `22110`
        </Admonition>
        The Compute Blade has a M.2 M key witch supports both SATA and NVMe Solid State Drives(SSD).
        The M.2 SSD can be Imaged the same as the microSD Card but requires an USB to M.2 NVME/SATA Adapter, such as the [UGREEN M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure Adapter](https://www.ugreen.com/collections/hard-drive-enclosure/products/ugreen-m-2-nvme-ssd-enclosure-adapter?variant=39915665195070).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="emmc" label="eMMC">
        <Admonition type="warning">
            eMMC only be imaged on Dev blade as it has USB-C port, USB switch, and `nRPIBOOT` button
        </Admonition>
        <Admonition type="note">
            CM4s with part number `CM4XXX000` do **NOT** have eMMC and are refered to a lite
            <img src='/img/cm4-box.png' width="250" alt='CM4 box with model number highlighted'/>
        </Admonition>
        Install [usbboot](/blade/advanced-guides/usbboot)
        From the usbboot directory run
        ```bash
        sudo ./rpiboot
        ```
        Move the USB switch to the USB-C position
        Then, while holding down the `nRPIBOOT` button on the blade connect the USB-C cable
        
        ![Compute Blade with USB and nRPIBOOT button highlighted](/img/blade/nRPIBOOT.png)
        
        The Device will reconect several times. on the last time it will appear as a USB media device.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). After installing run it. This software will be used to image the storage media.

![Raspberry Pi Imager Home](/img/imager/Imager-Home.png)

Select Rasspberry Pi 4

![Raspberry Pi Imager Device Filter](/img/imager/imager-device.png)

Select an operating system. We recomend Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit) `Operating System > Other general-purpose OS > Ubuntu > Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit)`

![Raspberry Pi Imager OS](/img/imager/imager-os.png)

Select stroage media

![Raspberry Pi Imager storage](/img/imager/imager-storage.png)

Click the `NEXT` then click the `EDIT SETTINGS` button. Two setting need to be edited

- `GENERAL > Set hostname` - This name will be used to connect to your blade later
- `GENERAL > Set username and password` - use your own username and password
- `GENERAL > Set locale setting`(Optional) - this will ajuste the blade locale setting 

![Raspberry Pi Imager setting general](/img/imager/imager-setting-general.png)

`SERVICES > Enable SSH` - Use password authntication
<Admonition type="info">
    `Allow public-key authentication only` is the more secure option but is more complex to set up. read More in our [SSH guide](/blade/getting_started/connect/#public-key-authentication)
</Admonition>

![Raspberry Pi Imager setting service](/img/imager/imager-setting-service.png)

Then click `SAVE`

Finally click `YES` and confirm that all existing data on the storage device will be erased by clicking `YES` again.
Raspberry Pi Imager will begin to write the OS to the storage device.

Once completed remove the storage device from the computer

## Install Storage Media in Blade

<Tabs groupId="boot" defaultValue="ssd">
    <TabItem value="microsd" label="microSD Card" >
        <Admonition type="warning">
            Only the Dev model Compute Blade has a microSD Card Slot
        </Admonition>
        Next to the top right corner of the CM4 you will find the microSD Card slot. Insert the card with the pins facing down
        ![computeblade mk4 sd card slot](/img/blade/computeblade-mk4-sd-box.png)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ssd" label="SSD">
        1. Remove the Kapton Tape from the standoff mount
        2. Using a 5mm hex driver attach the standoff
        3. Insert the M.2 SSD at a 30Â° angle and press down
        4. Place the plasitc washer on to the screw and use a PH1 driver to retain the M.2 SSD

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="emmc" label="eMMC">
        Unplug the USB-C cable from the Compute Blade and set the stwitch to USB-A
