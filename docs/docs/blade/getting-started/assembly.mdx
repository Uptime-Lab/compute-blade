The latch is now assembled and atached to the Compute Blade

## Compute module

The Compute Blade is build to support the Rassberry Pi Compute Module 4(CM4). 

:::warning
    Compute Blade is Made for the CM4 other compute module may **NOT** work as intended on the Compute Blade as they are not officially tested
:::

Align the CM4 board to board connecter with the Compute Blade

Then Press frimly until the CM4 is fully seated in the connecter.

## Heat Sink (Optional)

A heat sink is recomened to get the most out of your CM4. The Compute Blade Heat sink is built to give your Compute Blade the best preformace.
To install your heat sink your CM4 must be installed first see the above instructions if you need help. With the CM4 installed remove the plasict from the pre-applied thermal pads.
