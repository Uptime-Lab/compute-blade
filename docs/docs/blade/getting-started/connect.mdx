# Connect Using SSH

[Secure Shell Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)(SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating networked services securely over an unsecured network.
This is the most common way to connect to a Compute Blade.

## Installing SSH Client

To connect using SSH you will need a SSH client. there are a number of options available:
- [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) by Simon Tatham
- [Secure Shell](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/secure-shell/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd) by Google
- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) by OpenBSD Foundation

All of these clients will work, but for this guide we will be using OpenSSH.

    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

    To install [OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview)
    run PowerShell as an Administrator. To make sure that OpenSSH is available and not installed, run the following cmdlet:
    ```powershell
    Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH.Client*'
    ```
    The command should return the following output if it is not installed:
    ```txt
    Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
    State : NotPresent
    ```
    Then Run the following cmdlet to install the OpenSSH Client:
    ```powershell
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
    ```
    The command should return the following output:
    ```txt
    Path          :
    Online        : True
    RestartNeeded : False
    ```

    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    OpenSSH is included in MacOS out of the box; No installation required.

        Many distributions come with OpenSSH included but if yours does not here is how to install it on some common distributions:
        <Tabs groupId="pkgm" defaultValue="apt">
            <TabItem value="apt" label="Debian/Ubuntu">
                OpenSSH is listed in the `apt` package manager
                ```bash
                sudo apt update
                sudo apt upgrade
                sudo apt install openssh-client
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem value="yum" label="RHEL/Centos/Fedora">
            OpenSSH is listed in the `yum` package manager
                ```bash
                    sudo yum update
                    sudo yum upgrade
                    sudo yum install openssh-clients
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using SSH Command Line Interface

Using the Host name or IP address of the Blade we can use the command line to connect to it
```bash
ssh [user@]host-name-or-address
```
When connecting to a computer for the first time you will be asked if you are sure you want to connect. By typing `yes` a key fingerprint will be added to the list of known hosts.
```txt
ssh uptime@blade
The authenticity of host 'blade (192.168.1.100)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:10RTKd4AHOBM9lHPf938y4wCl7DiKoZWJAJ+Rcg6Rcg.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
Then enter your password
```txt
uptime@blade's password:
```
Once authenticated you will be presented with an active bash terminal.
```txt
uptime@blade:~$
```

### Notable Command Line Options

You may need to need to pass options to the SSH command when connecting. Here are some of the most used:
- `-p` Port to connect to on the remote host.
- `-l` Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.

## Public Key Authentication

Public key authentication provides cryptographic strength that even extremely long passwords can not offer.
With SSH, public key authentication improves security considerably, freeing users from remembering complicated passwords.

### Creating Key Pair

To create a key pair the OpenSSh Client includes the command
```bash
ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Append this in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (Create $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys if it does not already exist)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <user>@<remoteserver> # To use with your ssh client
```
