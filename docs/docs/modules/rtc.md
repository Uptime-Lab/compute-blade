# Real Time Clock

There are several Real Time Clock (RTC) modules available for the Raspberry Pi, which can be used to keep track of the current time even when the Pi is powered off. These modules typically use I2C communication and can be easily integrated into your projects.

Be sure when connecting a RTC module to use the pinout guide on your compute blade along with the pinout from the RTC modules data sheet to ensure correct wiring.
