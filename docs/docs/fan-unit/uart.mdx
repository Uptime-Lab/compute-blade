# Smart

The Smart Fan unit utilizes the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/specifications/) microcontroller featured in the [Raspberry Pi Pico 1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html). Using the RP2040's two UART connections, a link can be established to each blade using the fan connectors.

## Hardware

### Power Delivery
The Smart Fan Unit can be powered with +5V from both Blade `Port A` or `Port B` In addition to the USB Type-C for flashing. USB Type-C with not power the fan

### LEDs

The Smart Fan Unit has 5 LEDs

| LED  | Location | Type                               |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| LED1 | Yellow   | Programmable NeoPixel at index `0` |
| LED2 | Yellow   | Programmable NeoPixel at index `1` |
| LED3 | Red      | Green Programmable at `GPIO25`     |
| LED4 | Green    | Blue Power indicator for `Port A`  |
| LED5 | Green    | Blue Power indicator for `Port B`  |

### Button

A programmable button is located on on the rear of the Smart Fan Unit. It can be addressed at `GPIO12`

### Fan control

The Smart Fan Unit uses the [EMC2101](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/emc2101) from Microchip/SMSC a fan controller with temperature monitoring. The EMC2101 is connected over the I2C bus to the RP2040

The EMC2101 has two temperature sensors. An internal sensors on the IC(Red) located next to Port A and an external sensors(Green) located next to Port B

## Update Firmware

To start using the Smart Fan Unit, it should first be flashed with the latest firmware of your choice. This could be any custom firmware, or a pre-existing framework.

First, start by removing power from the Fan Unit. Then hold down the `BOOT` button and connect the USB Type-C to your computer.

{/* Image of fan unit with Boot held down and usb plugged in */}

The Fan Unit will now appear as a storage device labelled `RPI-RP2` on your computer.

{/* Windows file manager this PC */}

The firmware you are flashing should have the file extension `.uf2`
Move the `*.uf2` file into `RPI-RP2`, it should disconnect after a few seconds and reboot to the newly installed firmware.

## CircuitPython

We have prepared [example code](https://github.com/uptime-lab/circuitpy-fan-unit) to help you get started with your Smart Fan unit. Using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) which is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.

The code has the following basic functionality example :
- Button use
- LED control both Green and NeoPixel
- Fan control based on a simple fan curve
- UART communication

  | Temp Range         | Present Fan Speed |
  | :----------------: | :---------------: |
  | t >= 40C           | 100%              |
  | 35C {"<="} t < 40C | 70%               |
  | 33C {"<="} t < 35C | 60%               |
  | 31C {"<="} t < 33C | 40%               |
  | 29C {"<="} t < 31C | 30%               |
  | 29C < t            | 10%               |
</details>

### Installing CircuitPython
1. Download the latest version of [CircuitPython 9](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
2. With the Compute Blade connected from prior firmware flashing steps, move `adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-*.uf2` file into the `RPI-RP2` storage device
4. It will be disconnected and `LED 3` will blink green
3. The fan Unit with reconnect as `CIRCUITPY` will be connected

### Deploying Code example

1. Having installed `CircuitPython` and connecting the fan unit to your computer via USB-C
2. Download the [example code](https://github.com/uptime-lab/circuitpy-fan-unit) from GitHub
3. The code should be placed in `CIRCUITPY`; if prompted to replace any files, click yes

## Enable UART on CM4

To enable UART on the compute blade, open `/boot/firmware/config.txt`

```bash 
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

<Admonition type='info'>
    Instead of the BIOS found on a conventional PC, Raspberry Pi devices use a configuration file called config.txt. The GPU reads config.txt before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialized. Raspberry Pi OS looks for this file in the boot partition, located at `/boot/firmware/`.

    <sub>learn more about `config.txt` in [Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html)</sub>
</Admonition>

Then add the following lines:

```txt
[cm4]
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=uart5
```

Reboot the the Compute Blade. When it has restarted, the UART connection will be available at `/dev/ttyAMA5`

## Debugging

There is an unpopulated pin header labelled `J5` located below the B port on the Fan Unit.

These debug pins can be used with a tool like the [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html) to debug and program the RP2040.
