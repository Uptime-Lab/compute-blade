Start by installing the brackets onto the Fan. The brackets are toolless and will snap right on.

### Connecting to Compute Blade
:::info
    The Fan Units are designed to work with the [Blade Runner™️](/blade-runner) enclosures
:::

:::danger
    Plugging the Compute Blade into the Fan Unit incorrectly may lead to permanent damage to the fan unit and the blade.
:::

When connecting the blade to the Fan Unit the boards should be 90° relative to each other.
No additional work is need to make the Fan unit run.
