# Assembly

Fan Units will come in four parts:
- Fan Unit board
- Left Bracket
- Right Bracket
- 5V Fan v

:::note
    The Fan Unit is designed for a 5V fan like the Noctua [NF-A4x20 5V PWM](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a4x20-5v-pwm)

Start by installing the brackets onto the Fan. The brackets are toolless and will snap right on.

:::note
    The Fan Brackets are not symmetrical; ensure that the fan is correctly oriented for your desired air flow configuration.

### Connecting to Compute Blade
:::info
    The Fan Units are only designed to work with the [BladeRunner™™️](/bladerunner) enclosures
:::

When connecting the blade to the Fan Unit the boards should be 90° relative to each other. They use a square 4-pin connector and it is possible to connect them incorrectly out side of a BladeRunner enclosure. To avoid this please only connect the Fan Unit to the Compute Blade in a BladeRUnner Enclosure

:::danger
    Plugging the Compute Blade into the Fan Unit incorrectly may lead to permanent damage to the Fan Unit, Blade any device installed on the Blade.
:::

What the blade will look like without enclosure( **DO NOT DO** )
