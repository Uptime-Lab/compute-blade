# Standard




## Pins
The Compute blade uses [`GPIO12`](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin32_gpio12/) and [`GPIO13`](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin33_gpio13/) in their alternate PWM mode

## Control
Using a [python script](https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade-pwm-fan-control) you can read and control the fan.

Clone the GitHub repository to your blade and install the [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade-pwm-fan-control.git
cd ./compute-blade-pwm-fan-control/
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

To read the fan speed
```bash
python3 ./read_fan_speed.py
```
To control the fan speed
```bash
python3 ./fan_control.py
```

### Run in the background
To run the script with `nohup`
```bash
nohup python3 fan_control.py
```
:::note
[`nohup`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) is a POSIX command which means "no hang up".
Its purpose is to execute a command such that it ignores the HUP (hangup) signal
and therefore does not stop when the user logs out.
