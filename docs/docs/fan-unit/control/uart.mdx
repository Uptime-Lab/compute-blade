# Smart

The Smart Fan unit utilizes the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/specifications/) microcontroller featured in the [Raspberry Pi Pico 1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html). Using the RP2040's two UART connections, a link can be established to each blade using the fan connectors.

## Hardware

The A port on the Fan unit uses `UART0`, and the B port uses `UART1` on the RP2040. On the CM4, it connects using `UART5`. Both blade connectors can be used to power the Fan unit with +5V.

### Fan control

The Smart Fan Unit uses the [EMC2101](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/emc2101) from Microchip/SMSC a fan controller with temperature monitoring. The EMC2101 is connected over the I2C bus to the RP2040

## Update Firmware

To start using the Smart Fan Unit, it should first be flashed with the latest firmware of your choice. This could be any custom firmware, or a pre-existing framework.

First, start by removing power from the Fan Unit. Then hold down the `BOOT` button and connect the USB Type-C to your computer.

{/* Image of fan unit with Boot held down and usb plugged in */}

The Fan Unit will now appear as a storage device labelled `RPI-RP2` on your computer.

{/* Windows file manager this PC */}

The firmware you are flashing should have the file extension `.uf2`
Move the `*.uf2` file into `RPI-RP2`, it should disconnect after a few seconds and reboot to the newly installed firmware.

## CircuitPython

[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.

### Installing CircuitPython
1. Download the latest version of [CircuitPython 9](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
2. With the Compute Blade connected from prior firmware flashing steps, move `adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-*.uf2` file into the `RPI-RP2` storage device
4. It will be disconnected and `LED 3` will blink green
3. The fan Unit with reconnect as `CIRCUITPY` will be connected

### Deploying Code

1. Having installed `CircuitPython` and connecting the fan unit to your computer via USB-C
2. Download the [example code](https://github.com/uptime-industries/circuitpy-fan-unit)
3. The code should be placed in `CIRCUITPY`; if prompted to replace any files, click yes

### Enable UART on CM4

To enable UART on the compute blade, open `/boot/firmware/config.txt`

```bash 
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

<Admonition type='info'>
    Instead of the BIOS found on a conventional PC, Raspberry Pi devices use a configuration file called config.txt. The GPU reads config.txt before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialized. Raspberry Pi OS looks for this file in the boot partition, located at `/boot/firmware/`.

    <sub>learn more about `config.txt` in [Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html)</sub>
</Admonition>

Then add the following lines:

```txt
[cm4]
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=uart5
```

Reboot the the Compute Blade. When it has restarted, the UART connection will be available at `/dev/ttyAMA5`

## Debugging

There is an unpopulated pin header labelled `J5` located below the B port on the Fan Unit.

These debug pins can be used with a tool like the [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html) to debug and program the RP2040.
