# Control

The square connector at the end of the Blade main purpose is to connect a Fan Unit.
The output is 5V and should work with any fan that supports 5V.
The speed of the fan can be controlled with PWM.

But it can be used to control any 5v PWM fan. Or as an additional UART port (UART5 on CM4)

## PWM fan (STA Fan Unit)

:::note
When using the STA Fan Unit the speed of the fan can only be controlled from `port A`
:::

The using `GPIO12` and `GPIO13` the compute module can pass a PWM signal to the fan. Using a [python script](https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade-pwm-fan-control) you can Read and control the Fan.

Clone the Github repository to your blade
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uptime-industries/compute-blade-pwm-fan-control.git
cd ./compute-blade-pwm-fan-control/
```
To Read the The fan speed
```bash
python ./read_fan_speed.py
```
To control the fan speed
```bash
python ./fan_control.py
```
To run the script in the use `nohup`
```bash
nohup python fan_control.py
```
:::note
[`nohup`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) is a POSIX command which means "no hang up".
Its purpose is to execute a command such that it ignores the HUP (hangup) signal
and therefore does not stop when the user logs out.

## UART connection (Smart Fan Unit)

Enable `uart5` in `config.txt` by adding:

```txt
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=uart5
```

Next install a console we us `cu`. Next modify the permissions to `/dev/ttyAMA5`. Then we can connect over UART to the Fan Unit.

```bash
sudo apt install cu
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyAMA5
sudo cu --line /dev/ttyAMA5 --speed 115200
```

## Deploying to Fan Unit over USB (Smart Fan Unit)
Before starting, remove all power from the Fan Unit. Next hold down the `BOOTSEL` button and plug in the USB-C. 

{/* Image of fan unit BOOTSEL button */}

The Fan Unit will appear as a drive on your computer. Download the [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) `.uf2` file and move into the drive.
The drive will then disappear and a new one named `CIRCUITPY` will be connected. The [example code](https://github.com/uptime-industries/circuitpy-fan-unit) should be placed here to run.
