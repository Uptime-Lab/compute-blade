With the release of CM5, it is now possible to double the speed of the PCIe bus on the Compute Blade when working with the Compute Module from Raspberry Pi.
It's quite easy to do, and so far all the tests I've done show high stability of the solution.

## Configuration

All you need to do is to add to config.txt
at the very end of the file:

```txt
dtparam=pciex1
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
```
Then reboot the CM5

The CM5 is not certified for PCIe 3.0 not all features may be supported.
That is, you should be prepared that in some cases or with some devices it will not work at all or will work with problems.
But I haven't had any problems so far because of the PCIe 3.0 activation.
